Solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2020, in Python and Haskell.

I originally did all the challenges in Python. Most of these were coded for
coding speed rather than clarity, good design, or even good algorithm choice.
I started these a few days late, and worked on most challenges within a day or
so of release.

Later, I went back and re-did all the challenges in Haskell. I spent more
time on these solutions, but since I'm extremely new to Haskell, it's unlikely
the code is idiomatic, optimal, or any other good quality!
