Solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2020, in Python and Haskell.

I originally did all the challenges in Python. Most of these were coded for
coding speed rather than clarity, good design, or even good algorithm choice.
I started these a few days late, and worked on most challenges within a day or
so of release.

Later, I went back and re-did all the challenges in Haskell. I spent more
time on these solutions, but since I'm extremely new to Haskell, it's unlikely
the code is idiomatic, optimal, or any other good quality!

Later, I went back and re-did some/all of the challenges in C++, to get more
familiar with recent changes to the language and standard library. Again, it's
unlikely the code is idiomatic, optimal, or any other good quality, since I'm
learning new features and in some cases deliberately experimenting.
